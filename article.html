    <h2><mark><u>Chandrayaan 3 creates history and more</u></mark> </h2>
    <p>
        In a sense, India did create history via Chandrayaan 3 in that it was the first country 
        to land on the South Pole of the lunar surface. That is something no one has attempted till date. 
        Exactly 20 minutes prior to the landing time, ISRO initiated its <i><strong><u>Automatic Landing Sequence (ALS).</u></strong> </i>
        This well-tested and iterated process enabled Vikram LM to take charge and use its on-board computers
         and logic to identify a favourable spot. Not surprisingly, Chandrayaan 3 had a soft and decisive 
         landing on the moon. In a sense, it was a redemption for Dr Sivan, who had seen the Chandrayaan 
         2 mission fail by a whisker in last few minutes of landing.

        Fortunately, the event was managed <i>smoothly this time around.</i> <br>The Chandrayaan mission has thrown 
        <u>terra bytes</u> of data for the Indian space scientists to pore over,<br> but more importantly it will 
        sharpen our understanding of the mysteries of the universe. <br>Thanks to legendary scientists like 
        <strong>Vikram Sarabhai,  &nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Abdul Kalam, and  &nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Satish Dhawan</strong><br> India has a space program that is
         highly effective and has consistently delivered the goods in a very cost effective manner amidst the 
         plethora of budgetary constraints.
